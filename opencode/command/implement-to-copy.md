description: Generate implementation and copy code to clipboard
---

If the requested implementation already exists in the conversation history
(from a previous agent response or your own prior output), extract and copy
that code directly without regenerating it.

Otherwise, generate the requested implementation.

After providing your response, use the clipboard tool to copy ONLY the raw
code (no markdown fences, no explanations) to the user's clipboard.
