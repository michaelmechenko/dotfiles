# Commit message template (Conventional Commits)

```text
<type>(<scope>): <summary>

<What changed.>
<Why it changed.>
```

Notes:

- Keep the summary imperative and specific ("Add", "Fix", "Remove", "Refactor").
- Avoid implementation minutiae; focus on behavior and intent.
- If breaking: use `!` in header and/or add `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.
