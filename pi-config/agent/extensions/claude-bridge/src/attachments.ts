// content. CC writes one after editing a file, and the edit itself is already in
// pi's history as a tool call and its result, so the attachment duplicates context
// the rebuild reproduces anyway. It also usually hangs off a *tool result* record
// rather than a prompt, which has no position in the ordinal scheme below — on
// real sessions that left 81 of them unresolvable (see
// diag/attachment-coverage.mjs). Half-carrying a kind is worse than not claiming
// it: the ones that slipped through would be an arbitrary subset.
//
// Everything else CC rewrites every turn (`skill_listing`, `task_reminder`,
// `agent_listing_delta`, `mcp_instructions_delta`, …) and loses nothing.
