// In-process MCP server that exposes pi tools to Claude Code.
//
// Pi declares tool parameters as TypeBox objects, which are already JSON
// Schema at runtime — the same thing MCP puts on the wire. This serves them
// verbatim instead of going through the SDK's `createSdkMcpServer`, which only
// accepts Zod and therefore forces a JSON Schema → Zod → JSON Schema round
// trip. That round trip is lossy below the top level: nested objects collapse
// to open records and `anyOf`/`const` vanish, so Claude saw only the first
// level of any tool with a nested schema — including the builtin `edit`.
//
// Handlers go on the underlying protocol server rather than through
// `McpServer.registerTool`, which is the Zod-only path. Skipping registerTool
// also skips its argument validation, which is what we want: pi validates and
// executes tools itself, and the arguments MCP sees are discarded. A rejection
// there would only prevent the handler from running, stranding the call.
//
// This rests on the Agent SDK treating what we hand it as an opaque JSON-RPC
// endpoint: `connectSdkMcpServer` in sdk.mjs calls `instance.connect(transport)`
// and nothing else, so none of McpServer's higher-level machinery is required.
// The `McpServer` wrapper is kept only because the SDK's `mcpServers` option is
// typed against that class. If this breaks after an SDK update, check whether
// the SDK began inspecting the instance — reading registered tools, or expecting
// tools/list_changed notifications we never send.
