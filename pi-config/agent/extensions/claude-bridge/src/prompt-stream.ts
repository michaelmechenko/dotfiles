// Long-lived streaming-input prompt for query().
//
// The SDK accepts `prompt: AsyncIterable<SDKUserMessage>` and pumps it to the
// CLI's stdin. Keeping that iterable parked for the life of the query lets us
// write a steer to stdin *while* a tool is running, which is what makes CC
// drain it at the next tool boundary (`priority: "next"`) instead of treating
// it as a follow-up turn.
//
// The ack is the load-bearing part. `push()` resolves on the line *after*
// `yield`, and the SDK's pump is `for await (m of stream) { await
// transport.write(m) }` — so resuming past the yield proves the write to stdin
// completed. Callers await that before releasing the MCP tool result, which
// travels back over the same stdin FIFO; winning that race is what guarantees
// CC sees the steer before the tool result.
//
// The drain and the FIFO ordering are CC CLI internals, not SDK contract, so
// this can break under a CC upgrade without any type error.
