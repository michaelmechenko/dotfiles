# make-executable.sh - Add execute permissions to a list of files

# Method 1: Hardcoded list of files

# files=(
#     "file1.sh"
#     "file2.sh"
#     "scripts/helper.sh"
# )
# for file in "${files[@]}"; do
#     if [ -f "$file" ]; then
#         chmod +x "$file"
#         echo "✓ Made executable: $file"
#     else
#         echo "✗ File not found: $file"
#     fi
# done

# Method 2: Accept files as command-line arguments

# Usage: ./make-executable.sh file1.sh file2.sh file3.sh

for file in "$@"; do
